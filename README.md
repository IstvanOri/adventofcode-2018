# adventofcode-2018
My repository to solve puzzles on adventofcode.com and to learn Kotlin

2018 Event

# Getting started

After checkout run ```gradle run --args '[puzzle]'```

Where [puzzle] can be:
 - Order of the puzzle. Example: ```gradle run --args '1'```
 - Day of the puzzle. Example: ```gradle run --args 'Day1'```
 - Title of the puzzle. Example: ```gradle run --args 'Chronal Calibration'```
 
Of course the input files are containing my personal input data generated for me by the almighty algorithms of adventofcode.com, so that the default results are useless for others. But that's not the point anyway.
